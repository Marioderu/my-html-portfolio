<h1>The Best Movies According to Mario</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies. 2023 Edition</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</h3>
    <p>It's my most favourite videogamer ever. I used to play it all the time and it's got my name on it! I loved the movie and all its references.</p>

<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</h3>
    <p>One of my favourite sagas from the MCU (Marvel Universe). James Gunn did a brilliant job, best movie of this saga.</p>

<h3>Spider-man: Across the Spiderverse</h3>
    <p>I love the animation movies and I loved the first movie. This one is one of the best Spider-man movies ever made. It's got a lot of references of the comics, for those who read them.</p>
